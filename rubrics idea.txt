Bro lets do it so:
1.  Damage = ( extra time elapsed ** 0.5 )+(damage*Inaccuracies)
2.  here damage is calculated, i think we need to add a minimum time before which time induced damage is 0 
3.  The program has some level logic, yeah difficulty increases: 
     1. each level will mark increment of 4 characters
     2. proportinally the damage of time time will get subtle by (<current level> - 1)**0.5, hence itll form a smooth slope 
        that increases steadily. so gradually there will be lesser damage at the same time but the damage overall will increase with level
        what i mean to say is the damage intensity increases anyways but at the same point of time it'll remain the same.
     3. the inaccuracies will be the result of your skill issues 
4. we gotta test out these theories and make a simple total health, deduct points proportionally 
   if the person loses all his points in lvl x he is declared to have reached lvl x 
   no real winning criteria, simple as monkey type showing wpm. we show level reached.
5. we can revise rubrics to make better sense of because idts maam will have enough patience to listen out. 
6. but we have to atleast firm up the enemy logic:
   A. do we keep the random enemy 
   B. do we stick to the monkey type ideology i proposed
